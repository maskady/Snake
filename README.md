# Snake Project

## Description

This is a simple snake game made in C. It has been developed by me as a project to learn more about C programming. It is an evolution of [my first project](https://github.com/maskady/Snake_ncurses), which was the same game but with ncurses library. This version avoids the use of ncurses and flashing screens. It uses ANSI escape codes to move the cursor and print the snake and food on the screen.

## How to play

To play the game, you need to compile the game by running the following command:

```bash
make
```

And then you can run the game by running the following command:

```bash
./snake
```

To move the snake, you can use the arrow keys. The goal is to eat the food that appears on the screen and grow the snake as much as possible. If the snake collides with the walls or itself, the game is over. You win when you reach 100 points.
